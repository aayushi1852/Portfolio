            <p>
HI! I'M AAYUSHI. I AM A DESIGNER. MEANS I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STYLE. BECAUSE REAL DESIGNERS ADAPT TO CLIENTS. I WILL GO OUT OF MY WAY TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT ENHANCES YOUR BRAND AND TELLS YOUR STORY - NOT MINE.

I MAINLY DO WEB DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT BUT FROM TIME TO TIME I ALSO DO GRAPHIC DESIGN (PRINT), ILLUSTRATION, PACKAGING DESIGN AND PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE.</p>
