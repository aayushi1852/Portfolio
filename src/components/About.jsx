                    <p>HI! I'M AAYUSHI. I AM A DESIGNER. MEANS I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STYLE.
                        BECAUSE REAL DESIGNERS ADAPT TO CLIENTS. I WILL GO OUT OF MY WAY TO
                        MAKE SOMETHING THAT ENHANCES YOUR BRAND AND TELLS YOUR STORY - NOT MINE.
                        <br />
                        I MAINLY DO WEB DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT BUT FROM TIME TO TIME I ALSO DO GRAPHIC
                        DESIGN (PRINT), ILLUSTRATION AND PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE.
